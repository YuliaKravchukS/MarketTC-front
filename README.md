You need to install Docker Desktop https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
and run it

Enter the command "npm run docker" in the terminal and your project will be successfully started on "http://localhost:3000".

To stop the project, go to the terminal and press "Ctrl + C".

Also, if you change something (edit, add, delete...) outside the src directory, in order for the changes to take place, you need to restart the project (go to the terminal and press "Ctrl + C", enter the command "npm run docker" in the terminal)
